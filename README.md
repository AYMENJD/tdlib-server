## Usage

Here‚Äôs an example of how you can use [Pytdbot](https://github.com/pytdbot/client) to interact with **TDLib Server**:

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from pytdbot import Client
from pytdbot.types import Message

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="[%(levelname)s][%(filename)s:%(lineno)d][%(funcName)s] %(message)s",
)

client = Client(
    token="508903:AAGyYP5y63ihh_7KFX9aNiaHfajAmcAA",
    rabbitmq_url="amqp://username:password@0.0.0.0:5672/",  # RabbitMQ URL
)


@client.on_message()
async def say_hello(c: Client, message: Message):
    msg = await message.reply_text("Hey there! I'm cooking up a surprise... üç≥üë®‚Äçüç≥")

    async with message.action("choose_sticker"):
        await asyncio.sleep(5)

        await msg.edit_text("Boo! üëª Just kidding.")

client.run()
```

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and build **TDLib Server** on your system.

### Requirements
- **Go >= 1.21**
- **[TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td#building)**
- **[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/download)**

Once TDLib and RabbitMQ are installed, you're ready to build **TDLib Server**:

- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pytdbot/tdlib-server
    cd tdlib-server
    ```

- Build TDLib Server
    - If **TDLib is not installed system-wide** (a.k.a ``/usr/local``):
        ```bash
        TDLIB_DIR="/path/to/tdlib" make build
        ```
        Ensure you adjust the paths to match your installation directories.
        By default TDLib install files at ``td/tdlib``

    - If **TDLib is installed system-wide** (recommended), just do:
        ```bash
        make build
        ```

    - Optionally, you can install ``tdlib-server`` system-wide:
        ```bash
        make install
        ```
- Run the server:
  ```bash
  tdlib-server --config config.ini
  ```
